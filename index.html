      <h3>Leadership skill</h3>
      <p>I am currently standing as a President of the Ministry of Altar Servers in Sacred Heart of Jesus Chaplaincy located in Sangat San Fernando Cebu. As a President, I certainly inspire my members at all times. I stand as a role model for them, trying not to commit mistakes within the ministry. 
        In different situations, I usually don't lose hope as a leader, because I do believe that a leader cannot inspire his/her members if he/she is hopeless. As a President, I always motivate them to have faith with God always either in good or bad times.

      <h3>Guitar skill</h3>
      <p>Ever since I could remember, I have always wanted to play guitar. Guitar has always interested me, ever since I heard the beautiful music of my personal and musical hero, Ralph. His playing style just inspired me.
         I thought that, if I learned to play guitar, than I will be just like him and be able to play his incredible songs. I have learned from playing guitar was to keep on trying again and again until I accomplish what I attend to do. For playing guitar, this required me to keep playing the same songs, riffs, or chords over and over again, until I can memorize and play the particular part.

      <h3>Decision-making skill</h3>
      <p>I've always looking for a great choice in my life. I am taking precautionary measures in choosing what decisions I have to make. I can identify the situation, 
        look for the great solutions/actions and also determine the advantages and disadvantages of each option.
